//1. Implement Bellman Ford Algorithm to find the shortest path tree.
//
//a. your graph must have at least 10 nodes
//
//b. Your graph must have at least 15 edges.
//
//c. Some of the edge weights must be negative.
//
//d. Run the program on 2 cases - 1. The graph has negative edges but NO negative cycle. 2. Graph has a negative cycle.
//
//e. Your program must catch the negative cycle.
//
//f. submit code
//
//g submit the screen shot of execution.
